My name is Emad Idris, I am 23 years old and I am Palestinian. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Information Systems with a Good grade from Cairo, Egypt in 2020. I trained at STS in Amman, Jordan for two months in 2018 in the field of web development, and I took a course in the field of web development in Cairo, Egypt for five months in 2019. I want to gain more and more information in this field and I would like to develop myself in my field of work and be better than before

# Growth Mindset
> A **Growth Mindset** is “the understanding that abilities and understanding can be developed” (Mindset Works, n.d.). Those with a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting in time and effort , A **Growth Mindset** is a fantastic asset to have. The sky’s the limit for people like this, as they are always seeking to find new ways to learn. Importantly, individuals with Growth Mindsets are not fixated on being better than other people or receiving the best grades , People with a Growth Mindset enjoy being around people who are more skilled than them. They see spending time with more talented individuals as opportunities to learn new skills. Additionally, these people are always willing to discard a strategy if it is no longer working and replace it with a new approach. 

# Fixed Mindset
> On the flipside, a fixed mindset is one that assumes abilities and understanding are relatively fixed. Those with a fixed mindset may not believe that intelligence can be enhanced, or that you either “have it or you don’t” when it comes to abilities and talents.

# Fixed & Growth Mindset Differences
> *Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you?*

# 3 Reminders To Keep Your Growth Mindset During The Day:
1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
2. Celebrate growth with others.
3. Disassociate improvement from failure.
